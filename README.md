# ArcReactor-Gauntlet
Controlling your lighting system in Ironman (Jarvis) style.

### Small Intro
We are planning to implement a gesture controlled lighting
mechanism. We are envisioning this system for indoor lighting purposes
only. The gesture vocabulary would consist of waves and motions made
with the palm. These gestures would be read with the help of the Iron
Man’s Gauntlet. The “Laser Repulsor” in the palms would read the
gestures and convey it to the system to trigger the appropriate,
consequent change. The lighting mechanism on itself would consist of a
length strip of RGB LED lights. With the help of the gestures, we would
be able to turn the lights on and off, control the brightness, increase
or decrease the length of the strip that gets illuminated.
